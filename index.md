About Me
--------

I'm a programmer interested in algorithms, functional programming, and computability theory.
Check out some of my recent projects: 

A simple online polynomial factorizer I made for my math tutees:

Software Projects
-----------------

**GPU-based Genetic Algorithm**

*   Developed a "massively parallel" genetic algorithm that approximates Pi with inclined plane physics simulations.
*   Wrote an accompanying paper which details the mathematics and programming decisions.
*   **Utilized**: Python, Numba, Nvidia CUDA

**API-based Weather App**

*   Designed a weather app with a focus on flexible integration of multiple weather APIs.
*   Uses a factory method design pattern to decouple object creation from use.
*   **Utilized**: Python, Tkinter

**Advent of Code and Project Euler**

*   Completed Advent of Code 2021 and the first 75+ Project Euler problems (many of which are on GitHub).
*   **Utilized**: Python, C++, Haskell, Number Theory, Combinatorics, Matrices, Directed Graphs

**Physics Simulations**

*   Created a variety of physics simulations employing Euler and Verlet integration for soft-bodies, orbital mechanics, ideal gasses, and lattice-Boltzmann fluid simulations.
*   Wrote and incorporated various algorithms and data structures including k-d trees and quadtrees.
*   Inspired from attempts to learn concepts from physics and mathematics class more deeply.
*   **Utilized**: Python, Pygame

Education
---------

**George C. Marshall HS** | Falls Church, VA (August 2017-June 2021)

*   **Coursework** Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, IB Chemistry HL, IB Physics HL, IB Math HL. IB Diploma Recipient.
